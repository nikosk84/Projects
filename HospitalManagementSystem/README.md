Hospital Management System

The current project being constructed, using C# in Visual Studio and Microsoft SSMS is a Hospital Management System and its first steps will be to support CRUD. Its first development stage will involve:

1. Creating a hospital staff member/hospital vehicle/patient, and storing the relevant details in a database (using Dapper).
2. Finding/fetching an existing hospital staff member/patient from the database and displaying their details in a listbox.
3. Updating a hospital staff member, patient or vehicle record with new contact details/information.
4. Deleting any existing record from the database.

Hospital Management System has a goal of becoming a small sized, satisfactory Hospital Management System with useful features.
